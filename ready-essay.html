        <h2>Ready Player One Essay</h2>
        <p>This is an essay based on the novel Ready Player One written by Ernest Cline. 
            If you don't know anything about this novel it is about how Wade, the protagonist,
             plays in the OASIS, a popular virtual game where he can do everything he wants. 
             But then he begins to play the game for the fortune of James Halliday, the creator
              of the OASIS who recently passed. There are many themes that we see in this novel
               but the biggest one is the fact that all the players who play in the OASIS have 
               two identities, one virtual and one in real life. But which one is their actual 
               identity? That is what I analyzed throughout the text and realized that in order 
               for a human to become a stronger and better version of themselves they need to 
               face their real life obstacles. </p>
