        <p id="first-description">The company trion had tasked us to make a responsive website for both 
            mobile and desktop. I designed the merchandise page as well as the payment
            process. I brought this to life by coding the entire page and making it responsive 
            for all types of devices. I was able to achieve this goal by reviewing other marketing
            pages to get inspiration for my final product.</p>

            <p>My team and I were tasked by Trion Supercars to build an easy functioning and enjoyable
                 website for users. More specifically my task was to code and design the merchandise
                 page, as well as the payment process for this site.</p>

            <p>I used mostly HTMl and CSS but I was able to learn a little bit of JavaScript. 
                I also used Figma to really get an idea of what I wanted my design to look like.</p>

                    <p>I overcame using a layout concept called “flex-blox” which is how you more
                         things like, images, text, inside of a website</p>
