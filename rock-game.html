        <p>I used HTML, CSS, and a lot of JavaScript. I really wanted to test my
             abilities so I added really cool and flowy colors, as well as a scoreboard, 
             so you can keep track of who iss winning. I really had to overcome my abilities 
             with JavaScript which were not that great but I began to study the language and
              was able to get it down. I really had to be flexible with my thoughts and take
               a lot of risk since this was a side project and I was using extra time for it
                to learn another coding language.</p>
