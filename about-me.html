            <p>I love to code!! But that is not the only thing I do. I love to play
                soccer and play video games. My favorite is definitely Minecraft or
                Fortnite but I also love Call Of Duty Warzone. I enjoy spending quality
                time with my family, as well as, my dog, Benji, and my cat, Ace. </p>
                <p>My post-secondary plans are to graduate college with a degree in cyber
                    security. After college I want to get a job as a security analyst and
                    move up in rankings along my journey. </p>
